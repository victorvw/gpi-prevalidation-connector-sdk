# **verifyAccount**
> AccountVerificationResponse1 verifyAccount(body, laUApplicationID, laUVersion, laUCallTime, laURequestNonce, laUSigned, laUSignature, xBic, subjectDN, institution)

Verify that a beneficiary account could be able to receive incoming funds.

The service verifies that an account exists at the beneficiary bank and is capable of receiving incoming funds. This usually implies that the account is open, properly identified by the given number and, depending on the  jurisdiction and the market practices in use where the account is held, that the creditor name matches the name of the account holder. The service provider does not take liability for the response and does not provide any guarantee on the outcome of an actual transaction being sent to this account. The information provided is meant to be as accurate as possible at the time that the request was processed.  The requester must pass the creditor name and the service provider can use this information as part of the verification or not. 

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
//import com.swift.gpi.preval.ApiClient;
//import com.swift.gpi.preval.ApiException;
//import com.swift.gpi.preval.Configuration;
//import com.swift.gpi.preval.auth.*;
//import com.swift.gpi.preval.api.VerifyAccountApi;

ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();

// Configure API key authorization: SwiftLAU
ApiKeyAuth SwiftLAU = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("SwiftLAU");
SwiftLAU.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//SwiftLAU.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

VerifyAccountApi apiInstance = new VerifyAccountApi();
AccountVerificationRequest body = new AccountVerificationRequest(); // AccountVerificationRequest | Verify Account Details Request.
String laUApplicationID = "laUApplicationID_example"; // String | ID that identifies the application generating the API and used by the gpi Connector to retrieve the related LAU keys, required for consumers using gpi connector only
String laUVersion = "laUVersion_example"; // String | version of the LAUSigned header. Mandatory. \"1.0\" for this first release, required for consumers using gpi connector only
String laUCallTime = "laUCallTime_example"; // String | timestamp in UTC of the API call in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ, required for consumers using gpi connector only
String laURequestNonce = "laURequestNonce_example"; // String | a random value generated by the client consumer. Provided with the request and copied by the gpi Connector on the response, required for consumers using gpi connector only
String laUSigned = "laUSigned_example"; // String | service specific HTTP headers composed of apiKey, rbac role and bic to route the request, required for consumers using gpi connector only
String laUSignature = "laUSignature_example"; // String | contains the LAU (SHA256) signature, base64 encoded, required for consumers using gpi connector only
String xBic = "xBic_example"; // String | describe the BIC for SWIFT to route the request, providers get the value and consumers are not required to fill it in
String subjectDN = "subjectDN_example"; // String | describe the distinguish name of the consumer, providers get the value and consumers are not required to fill it in
String institution = "institution_example"; // String | describe the BIC of the consumer, providers get the value and consumers are not required to fill it in
try {
    AccountVerificationResponse1 result = apiInstance.verifyAccount(body, laUApplicationID, laUVersion, laUCallTime, laURequestNonce, laUSigned, laUSignature, xBic, subjectDN, institution);
    System.out.println(result);
} catch (ApiException e) {
